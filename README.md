# Event_Trigger_Folder_Checking
Watchdog algorithm to successfully monitor the folder concurrently whenever new file created and logs are stored
Install the watchdog module
Install the os module
If we use local machine to monitor cloud path then use four slashes'\\\\' before the file path
If we need to implement this in development server then use mounted folder path to work correctly
